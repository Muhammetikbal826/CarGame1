Hello! 
Thank you for buying!

Here is small instruction...

Please, use Black_SP sprites from/Sprites folder. All sorted into folders.

All the basic motion of objects is done using animation. 
However, the saw is rotated by script TrapControll.cs. 
In it, you can set the speed of rotation, direction. 
In addition to saws provided with a sound rotation.
If you wish to change any of the sprites, 
it is very convenient to do because in photoshop they are decomposed into separate layers.

Thank you again!

If you have any questions, feel free to contact: andrew.olenk@gmail.com

Best regards, Andrew!
